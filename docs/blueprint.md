# **App Name**: CodeFlow

## Core Features:

- Code Input: Accept code input from a text area or file upload.
- Mermaid Generation: Automatically generate a Mermaid diagram representing the code's structure and relationships. This feature uses a tool that decides what code elements and relationship to visualize in the Mermaid diagram.
- Diagram Display: Display the generated Mermaid diagram in a dedicated panel.
- Code Highlighting: Allow users to highlight specific parts of the code in the input editor and corresponding elements in the Mermaid diagram.
- Diagram Export: Enable users to download the Mermaid diagram as an image (e.g., PNG, JPEG) or a Mermaid file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium-dark indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of intellect and code.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright violet (#EE82EE) to highlight interactive elements and call attention to details.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, line-based icons for actions like 'upload,' 'download,' and 'generate.'
- Employ a split-screen layout with the code editor on one side and the Mermaid diagram on the other.
- Use subtle transitions when the Mermaid diagram updates to provide a smooth visual experience.
